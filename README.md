# Analysis of Wage Differences  
In an era of increasing awareness and emphasis on equal opportunities in the workplace, the issue of wage discrimination continues to be a subject of paramount concern. What are the factors that unfairly affect workers' compensation? With the goal of addressing this issue, we dive into a subset of the $\textit{1985 Current Population Survey}$, containing information about personal details and professional backgrounds of 534 workers in the United States.

We aim to investigate potential correlations between hourly wages and specific worker attributes. Specifically, our analysis will primarily address potential gender-related wage disparities, while also accounting for variables such as educational attainment, work experience, and marital status.

### Reproducibility of the code
We used R version 4.2.3.  
No virtual environment is required.   
To reproduce the analysis that we presented in `report.pdf`, you only need to render the file `report.qmd` that you can find in the repository. It will open to you an HTML page with our analysis.
